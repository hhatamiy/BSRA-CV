"""Shared type definitions passed between subteams.

Detection produces `Detection` objects; integration consumes them and
produces `PerceptionObject` objects (robot-relative positions) that get
published as ROS 2 perception messages. Keeping these dataclasses here
means the message schema in integration-team/messages/ and the model
output format in detection-team/inference/ stay in sync.
